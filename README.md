 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 <p>
    I began my coding journey as a computer engineering student, fueled by curiosity and a deep desire to understand how things were made and how they worked. I delved into various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Mastering frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I honed my skills in crafting visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. Simultaneously, I dived into backend development, learning languages such as PHP and JavaScript with CMS like WordPress. This comprehensive skill set ultimately led me to become a full stack developer, capable of seamlessly bridging the gap between frontend and backend development, and bringing my own ideas to life.
 </p>
 <p>
   Today, as a full stack developer, I relish the opportunity to design and develop my own applications and websites, providing end-to-end solutions and a seamless user experience. The satisfaction of transforming abstract concepts into tangible, functional programs fuels my passion for this field. I continuously seek to stay updated with the latest technologies and industry trends, committed to lifelong learning and growth. As I embark on new challenges, I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead and the opportunity to create innovative digital experiences that have a positive impact.
